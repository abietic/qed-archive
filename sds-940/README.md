# QED For The SDS 940

## Introduction

These files were supplied to me by Lars Brinkhoff (lars AT nocrew.org).

Some if not all of the files originally came from Bitsavers.org; they were
recovered by Al Kossow (aek AT bitsavers.org).

## Contents

The two `.txt` files are the source for the editor itself, in
assembly language.

There are two different reference manuals, one fron 1968, and one
from 1969, describing QED.
